Undergraduate course at UFSM lectured by Dr. Paulo Mareze.

## Sound absorption and 1 degree of freedom vibration modeling
- Adds `helmholtz_layer` to the [TMM](https://github.com/rinaldipp/tmm) package;
- Transmissibility plots for vibration control analysis.

## Installation
The [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager is the recommended way to use this project. Clone the repository, `cd` into the project folder and run `uv sync`. This will install all dependencies. Afterwards, you can run `uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab` to start the JupyterLab environment and explore the notebooks.
